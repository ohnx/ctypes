about
    ctypes is a collection of different simple types (ie, list, tree),
    functions that operate on these types, as well as some other miscellaneous
    functions implemented in C. the operations on these types are mostly
    inspired by higher-level languages such as Java.

download
    find the latest stable release at https://github.com/ohnx/ctypes/releases
    if you like to live life on the edge, you can also checkout/clone the
    main branch of this repository. there is a 80% chance the code is stable,
    but no guarantees.

types added
    as of right now, ctypes has 2 types, with more planned.
    they are as follows:
      - List
      - Hashmap
    to use any of these types, just include the corresponding header files.

    for sample usage of any of these types or other help, please visit
    the directory /docs.

credits
    portions of this code (the hashmap) are based on Pete Warden's
    code (which can be found at https://github.com/petewarden/c_hashmap) and
    Zaks Wang's code (which can be found at
    https://github.com/ultimate010/c_hashmap)

contributing
    please feel free to contribute problems you have with ctypes (in the
    form of GitHib issues) or solutions for some problems you have had
    (in the form of pull requests). other than that, optimization for
    existing functions is also welcome.
